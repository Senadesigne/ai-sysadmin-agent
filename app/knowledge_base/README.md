# Knowledge Base (Starter Kit)

This folder contains example documents for the optional RAG feature.

## How to use
- Add your own `.md`, `.txt`, or `.pdf` files here.
- Run the ingest script (if enabled in this project) to index the documents.
- Set `RAG_ENABLED=true` in `.env` to enable retrieval.

## Notes
- In the starter kit, this folder should contain only generic sample docs.
- Project/client-specific documents should live in project branches, not in the starter kit.
